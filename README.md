# Quantum-Rift
Quantum Rift is a project. I'm working on for FAF (Forged Alliance Forever). This mod represent the true scale and power of the Seraphim. While also giving a new playstyle if your fighting or playing the Seraphim. 

What Do I wanna do with this Mod


1) Spawn Random Selection of Seraphim, constantly out of the Rift. Every 2 to 5, A Experimental will come out of the Rift. 
2) Add Specific Seraphim Rift Invasion Units (Only come from the Rift)
3) Events (Sorta Like Campaign Scripts For The Rift. Maybe A Seraphim AI Script Commander Comes out of the gate and sets up a base. Those Sorta of Things)
4) Make an Entire New Model for The Rift and Effects. [WIP]
5) Buffed Stats for Invasion Units (Most likely will be completely separate units, only spawned in by the Rift)
6) Add Different Kinds of Commanders (Like Specific Commander Roles for Support Commanders) [Combat Commander With Abilities. Base Builder Commanders Scripted to build base. Probably with some sort of Base Generator]

7)Adapting Spawns Best on How the Seraphim or doing/what they are lacking

8)Possibly Spawn Transport with Units on them (Like Half or a Third)

Keep in Mind These Are Just Ideas RN (There will be most likely a new Model For the Rift)
